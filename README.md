# ssd1306 + esp32c5 proj
* js fuck around and find out
* for now, just brightness counter
## ideas
* niconico / bilibili comment text scroller display, 
* polls API and lets random people write whatever they want
* same for drawing. display is 64x128 so i could let ppl do r/place. it's only black and white though so a bit limited
* set brightness as well
* bus timer

* stuff needed for all of this is obviously wifi and https / json support so time to impl that yay
